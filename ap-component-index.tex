\section{Proof of \Cref{clm:component-index}}

From \Cref{prop:coproduct-as-polynomial-functor}, we see that the \kl{component} in $1 \oplus 1$ of an element in $A \oplus 1$ is obtained by applying $!\oplus1$. So it suffices to show that
\[\tuple{\underline{w}|\underline{v}} = (!\oplus1)(\tuple{w|\underline{v}}) \]
Expanding the definitions, our goal can be rewritten as
\[ \text{vectorial output of}\ (\functor! \circ h(w),\, \functor! \circ h(v)) = (!\oplus1)\big(\text{vectorial output of}\ (h(w),\, \functor! \circ h(v))\big) \]
This is a direct consequence of the \kl{naturality} of the \kl{vectorial output function}, that can be expressed as follows: for every semigroup homomorphism $g\colon A \to B$,
\[ (\text{vectorial output for $B$}) \circ (\functor g \times \mathrm{id}_1) = (g\oplus1) \circ \text{vectorial output for $A$} \]
(take $g=\;!$ and apply both sides of the equality to $(h(w),\, \functor! \circ h(v))$ to get the desired result).
