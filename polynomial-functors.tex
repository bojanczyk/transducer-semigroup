\subsubsection{Coproducts and views}
\label{sec:coproducts-and-views}

Apart from the more abstract transducer model from Definition~\ref{def:functorial-sst}, the other ingredient used  in the proof of the hard implication in Theorem~\ref{thm:regular-functions} will be \kl{coproducts} of semigroups, and some basic operations on them, as described in this section.

\AP The \intro{coproduct}\footnote{The name \emph{coproduct} is used because of the following universal property: if $f\colon A \to C$ and $g\colon B \to C$ are two semigroup homomorphisms, then there is a unique homomorphism 
      $A \oplus B \to C$
  that coincides with $f$ (resp.~$g$) on the subsemigroup consisting of words with a single letter from $A$ (resp.~$B$).}  of two semigroups $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \oplus B$, is the semigroup whose elements are nonempty words over an alphabet that is the disjoint union of $A$ and $B$, restricted to words that are \emph{alternating} in the sense that two consecutive letters cannot belong to the same semigroup. The semigroup operation is defined in the expected way. We draw elements of a \kl{coproduct} using coloured boxes, with the following picture showing the product operation in the coproduct of two copies, \red{red} and \blue{blue}, of the semigroup $\set{a,b}^+$:
\begin{align*}
    (\red{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
    \blue{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
    \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
    \blue{\boxed{aa}}) \cdot 
    (
        \blue{\boxed{abba}} \cdot 
        \red{\boxed{aabb}}
    )
    = 
\red{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
    \blue{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
    \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
    \blue{\boxed{aaabba}} \cdot 
        \red{\boxed{aabb}}.
\end{align*}
A \kl{coproduct} can involve more than two semigroups; in the pictures this would correspond to more colours, subject to the condition that  consecutive boxes have different colours.
\begin{remark}
  The \kl{copyless} \kl{register updates} $u : R \to (A + R)^+$ of ordinary \sst{}s that are in \kl{normal form} (cf.~\Cref{sec:easy}) can be seen as maps $R \to A \oplus \displaystyle \bigoplus_{X\in R} \{X\}^+$.
\end{remark}

We write $1$ for the semigroup that has one element. This semigroup is unique up
to isomorphism and it is a \emph{terminal object} in the category of semigroups,
which means that it admits a unique homomorphism from every other semigroup $A$.
This unique homomorphism will be denoted by $!\colon A \to 1$. (It has no
connection with the factorial function on numbers.)

Consider the semigroup-to-set functors defined by (the underlying set of) a
\kl{coproduct} of several copies of their argument with several copies of $1$,
such as $A \mapsto A \oplus A \oplus A \oplus 1 \oplus 1$. In our proof, it will
be useful to see them as \kl{polynomial functors}, even though strictly speaking
they are not defined as sums of products. This identification is allowed by the
following observation (stated for $A\oplus1$ for convenience, but the same idea
applies in general).
\begin{proposition}
  There is a family of bijections, natural in the semigroup $A$, between
  \begin{align*}
    A \oplus 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \coprod_{q \in 1 \oplus 1} A^{\text{\kl{dimension} of $q$}},
  \end{align*}
  where the \kl{dimension} of $q$ is the number of times that the
  first copy of $1$ appears in $q$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Idea]
  Given $x\in A\oplus1$, we apply $!\colon A\to1$ to the elements of $A$ in $x$
  to determine the component $q$ of the \kl{polynomial functor} that contains
  the image of $x$ by the left-to-right bijection. This operation, a special
  case of what is called the \kl{shape} below, forgets those elements of $A$
  appearing in $x$, so we record them in a tuple living in $A^{\dim(q)}$. For
  example, $\red{\boxed{aba}} \cdot {\boxed{1}} \cdot \red{\boxed{aa}} \cdot
  \boxed{1}$ is sent to the tuple $(aba,aa)$ in the component $\red{\boxed{1}}
  \cdot {\boxed{1}} \cdot \red{\boxed{1}} \cdot \boxed{1}$.
\end{proof}

The crucial property of semigroups that will be used in our proof is \Cref{lem:views} below, which says that an element of a \kl{coproduct} can be reconstructed based on certain partial information. This information is described  using the following operations.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \AP \textbf{Merging}. Consider a coproduct $A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n$, such that the same semigroup $A$ appears on all coordinates from a subset $I \subseteq \set{1,\ldots,n}$, and possibly on other coordinates as well. Define \intro{merging the parts from $I$} to be the function of type 
    \begin{align*}
        A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n \to  A \oplus \bigoplus_{i \not \in I} A_i
        \end{align*}
    that is defined in the expected way, and explained in the following picture. In the picture, \kl{merging} is applied to a coproduct of three copies of the semigroup $\set{a,b}^+$, indicated using colours \red{red}, black and \blue{blue}, and the merged coordinates are \red{red} and \blue{blue}:
        \begin{align*}
        \blue{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
        \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
        \boxed{aa} \cdot 
        \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
        \blue{\boxed{aa}} \cdot 
        \red{\boxed{abba}} \cdot 
        \boxed{b}
        \quad \mapsto \quad  
        \myunderbrace{
            \violet{\boxed{abab}} \cdot 
        \boxed{aa} \cdot 
        \violet{\boxed{baaabba}} \cdot 
        \boxed{b}
        }{the merge of \red{red} and \blue{blue} is drawn in \violet{violet}}.\end{align*}    
        \item \AP \textbf {Shape.}  Define the \intro{shape operation} to be the function of type 
        \begin{align*}
        A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n \to 1 \oplus \cdots \oplus 1
        \end{align*}
        obtained by applying $!$ on every coordinate. The \kl{shape} says how many alternating blocks there are, and which semigroups they come from, as explained in the following picture:
        \begin{align*}
            \blue{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
            \boxed{aa} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
            \blue{\boxed{aa}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{abba}} \cdot 
            \boxed{b}
            \quad \mapsto \quad  
            \blue{\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \boxed{1} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \blue{\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \boxed{1}.
        \end{align*}
        \item \AP \textbf{Views.} The final operation is the $i$-th \intro{view}
        \begin{align*}
        A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n \to 1 \oplus A_i.
        \end{align*}
        This operation applies $!$ to all coordinates other than $i$, and then it \kl{merges} all those coordinates. Here is a picture, in which we take the \kl{view} of the \blue{blue} coordinate:
        \begin{align*}
            \blue{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
            \boxed{aa} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
            \blue{\boxed{aa}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{abba}} \cdot 
            \boxed{b}
            \quad \mapsto \quad  
            \blue{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
            {\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \blue{\boxed{aa}} \cdot 
            \boxed{1}.
        \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
The key observation is that an element of a \kl{coproduct} is fully determined
from its \kl{shape} and \kl{views}, as stated in the following lemma.
It seems to contain the essential property of semigroups that makes the
construction work. We expect our theorem to also be true for other algebraic
structures for which the lemma is true; however, the lemma seems to fail in
certain settings. Concrete examples will be discussed in the conclusion (\Cref{sec:conclusion}).
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:views} Let $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ be semigroups. The \intro{deconstruction} function of type
\begin{align*}
A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n \longrightarrow (1 \oplus A_1) \times \cdots \times (1 \oplus A_n) \times (1 \oplus \cdots \oplus 1),
\end{align*}
which is obtained by combining the \kl{views} for all $i \in \set{1,\ldots,n}$ and the \kl{shape}, is injective. 
\end{lemma}
\AP We prove this by exhibiting an explicit partial left inverse: a
\intro{reconstruction} function of type
\[ \qquad (1 \oplus A_1) \times \cdots \times (1 \oplus A_n) \times (1 \oplus
  \cdots \oplus 1) \longrightarrow (A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n) + 1 \]
deconstruction followed by reconstruction maps every element of $A_1
\oplus \cdots \oplus A_n$ to itself. The idea is to start with the \kl{shape}
and replace the entries from $1$ with the elements appearing in the
\kl{views} in the right order. Rather than a formal definition, we illustrate
this on an example (in the three views, we omit the boxes around the 1s to avoid
visual cluttering):
\[\arraycolsep=1.4pt\def\arraystretch{1.2}
  \begin{array}{ccccccc}
    \blue{\boxed{aba}}
    & & 1 & &
    \blue{\boxed{aa}} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{1} \\
    1 &
    \red{\boxed{b}} &  
    1 & 
    \red{\boxed{b}} & 
    1 & 
      \red{\boxed{abba}} & 1\\
     \multicolumn{2}{c}{1} & 
    \boxed{aa} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{1} & 
    \boxed{b}\\
    \blue{\boxed{1}} &
    \red{\boxed{1}} &
    \boxed{1} &
    \red{\boxed{1}} &
    \blue{\boxed{1}} &
    \red{\boxed{1}} &
    \boxed{1}
  \end{array}
  \qquad\mapsto\qquad \blue{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
  \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
  \boxed{aa} \cdot 
  \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
  \blue{\boxed{aa}} \cdot 
  \red{\boxed{abba}} \cdot 
  \boxed{b}
\]
Besides proving \Cref{lem:views}, this reconstruction function also enjoys the
following property, which can be seen from the definition.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:reconstruction}
  When each $A_i$ is either $A$ or $1$, \kl{reconstruction} can be seen as a \kl{copyless natural function} between \kl{polynomial functors} in $A$.
\end{proposition}
