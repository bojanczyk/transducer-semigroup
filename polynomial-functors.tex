\label{sec:coproducts-and-views}

Apart from the more abstract transducer model from Definition~\ref{def:functorial-sst}, the other ingredient used  in the proof of the hard implication in Theorem~\ref{thm:regular-functions} will be \kl{coproducts} of semigroups, and some basic operations on them, as described in this section.

\AP The \intro{coproduct}  of two semigroups $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \oplus B$, is the semigroup whose elements are nonempty words over an alphabet that is the disjoint union of $A$ and $B$, restricted to words that are \emph{alternating} in the sense that two consecutive letters cannot belong to the same semigroup. The semigroup operation is defined in the expected way. We draw elements of a \kl{coproduct} using coloured boxes, with the following picture showing the product operation in the coproduct of two copies, \red{red} and \blue{blue}, of the semigroup $\set{a,b}^+$:
\begin{align*}
    (\red{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
    \blue{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
    \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
    \blue{\boxed{aa}}) \cdot 
    (
        \blue{\boxed{abba}} \cdot 
        \red{\boxed{aabb}}
    )
    = 
\red{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
    \blue{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
    \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
    \blue{\boxed{aaabba}} \cdot 
        \red{\boxed{aabb}}.
\end{align*}
A \kl{coproduct} can involve more than two semigroups; in the pictures this would correspond to more colours, subject to the condition that  consecutive boxes have different colours.
\begin{remark}
  The \kl{copyless} \kl{register updates} $u : R \to (A + R)^+$ of ordinary \sst{}s that are in \kl{normal form} (cf.~\Cref{sec:easy}) can be seen as maps $R \to A \oplus \displaystyle \bigoplus_{X\in R} \{X\}^+$.
\end{remark}
% The name \emph{coproduct} is used because of the following universal property: if
% \begin{align*}
% f : A \to C \qquad \text{and} \qquad g : B \to C
% \end{align*}
% are two semigroup homomorphisms, then
% there is a unique homomorphism 
% \[
% \begin{tikzcd}
% f \text{ or } g : A \oplus B \to C
% \end{tikzcd}
% \]
% that coincides with $f$ (resp.~$g$) on the subsemigroup of $A \oplus B$ consisting of words with a single letter from $A$ (resp.~$B$).

We write $1$ for the semigroup that has one element. This semigroup is unique up to isomorphism and it is a \emph{terminal object} in the category of semigroups, which means that it admits a unique homomorphism from every other semigroup $A$. This unique homomorphism will be denoted by $!\colon A \to 1$. (It has no connection with the factorial function on numbers.)

\begin{remark}[used in our proof]
    \label{rem:coproduct-as-polynomial-functor}
    %The polynomial functors that we  use in our proof will arise using coproducts with the singleton semigroup $1$. 
    Consider the semigroup-to-set functor $A \mapsto A \oplus 1$, which maps a semigroup to the underlying set of its coproduct with the singleton semigroup. Although not defined as a \kl{polynomial functor}, this functor is isomorphic to one. This is because for every semigroup $A$ there is a bijective correspondence between the sets
    \begin{align*}%\label{eq:polynomial-representation-of-coproduct}
    A \oplus 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \coprod_{q \in 1 \oplus 1} A^{\text{\kl{dimension} of $q$}},
    \end{align*}
    where the \kl{dimension} of $q$ is defined to be the number of times that the first copy of $1$ appears in $q$. Furthermore, this bijection is \kl{natural} in $A$, and thus we can speak of $A \oplus 1$ as being a \kl{polynomial functor}. This remark applies to similar constructions, which involve a \kl{coproduct} of several copies of $A$ with several copies of $1$, such as $A \oplus A \oplus A \oplus 1 \oplus 1$.
    %Mikolaj: I eliminated parts of this discussion, since they can be inserted (in the reader's head) at the places where they are used
    % bijection in~\eqref{eq:polynomial-representation-of-coproduct} is natural, and therefore there is a natural bijection between the functor $(-) \oplus 1$ and some polynomial functor. Also, if two polynomial functors are connected by a natural bijection, then they are the same, up to renaming of the components, and therefore the representation in~\eqref{eq:polynomial-representation-of-coproduct} is unique up to renaming of components. By uniqueness, we will simply speak of $A \oplus 1$ as being a polynomial functor.  In a similar way, functors such as $A \mapsto A \oplus 1 \oplus A$ are also polynomial.
    % Noting that $\oplus$ makes sense as an operation on sets without a semigroup structure (it builds a set of nonempty alternating sequences), we have more generally that, if $\functor$ is a polynomial functor, then so is $A \mapsto \functor A \oplus 1$. 
\end{remark}







% \begin{example}\label{ex:copyless-on-coproducts}
%     Consider the functor \enquote{$A\mapsto$ underlying set of $A \oplus 1$} from Example~\ref{ex:coproduct-as-polynomial-functor}, which was shown to be a polynomial functor. The natural transformation in $A$
%     \begin{align*}
%     (A \oplus 1)\times (A \oplus 1) \longrightarrow A \oplus 1
%     \end{align*}
%     which describes the semigroup operation in the coproduct $A \oplus 1$ is copyless.
% \end{example}


% \subsubsection{Views}
% \label{sec:views}

The crucial property of semigroups that will be used in our proof is \Cref{prop:views} below, which says that an element of a \kl{coproduct} can be reconstructed based on certain partial information. This information is described  using the following operations.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \AP \textbf{Merging}. Consider a coproduct $A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n$, such that the same semigroup $A$ appears on all coordinates from a subset $I \subseteq \set{1,\ldots,n}$, and possibly on other coordinates as well. Define \intro{merging the parts from $I$} to be the function of type 
    \begin{align*}
        A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n \to  A \oplus \bigoplus_{i \not \in I} A_i
        \end{align*}
    that is defined in the expected way, and explained in the following picture. In the picture, \kl{merging} is applied to a coproduct of three copies of the semigroup $\set{a,b}^+$, indicated using colours \red{red}, black and \blue{blue}, and the merged coordinates are \red{red} and \blue{blue}:
        \begin{align*}
        \blue{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
        \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
        \boxed{aa} \cdot 
        \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
        \blue{\boxed{aa}} \cdot 
        \red{\boxed{abba}} \cdot 
        \boxed{b}
        \quad \mapsto \quad  
        \myunderbrace{
            \violet{\boxed{abab}} \cdot 
        \boxed{aa} \cdot 
        \violet{\boxed{baaabba}} \cdot 
        \boxed{b}
        }{the merge of \red{red} and \blue{blue} is drawn in \violet{violet}}.\end{align*}    
        \item \AP \textbf {Shape.}  Define the \intro{shape operation} to be the function of type 
        \begin{align*}
        A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n \to 1 \oplus \cdots \oplus 1
        \end{align*}
        obtained by applying $!$ on every coordinate. The \kl{shape} says how many alternating blocks there are, and which semigroups they come from, as explained in the following picture:
        \begin{align*}
            \blue{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
            \boxed{aa} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
            \blue{\boxed{aa}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{abba}} \cdot 
            \boxed{b}
            \quad \mapsto \quad  
            \blue{\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \boxed{1} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \blue{\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \boxed{1}.
        \end{align*}
        \item \AP \textbf{Views.} The final operation is the $i$-th \intro{view}
        \begin{align*}
        A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n \to 1 \oplus A_i.
        \end{align*}
        This operation applies $!$ to all coordinates other than $i$, and then it \kl{merges} all those coordinates. Here is a picture, in which we take the \kl{view} of the \blue{blue} coordinate:
        \begin{align*}
            \blue{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
            \boxed{aa} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
            \blue{\boxed{aa}} \cdot 
            \red{\boxed{abba}} \cdot 
            \boxed{b}
            \quad \mapsto \quad  
            \blue{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
            {\boxed{1}} \cdot 
            \blue{\boxed{aa}} \cdot 
            \boxed{1}.
        \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
The key observation is that an element of a \kl{coproduct} is fully determined
from its \kl{shape} and \kl{views}, as stated in the following lemma.
It seems to contain the essential property of semigroups that makes the
construction work. We expect our theorem to also be true for other algebraic
structures for which the lemma is true; however, the lemma seems to fail in
certain settings. Concrete examples will be discussed in the conclusion (\Cref{sec:conclusion}).
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:views} Let $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ be semigroups. The \intro{deconstruction} function of type
\begin{align*}
A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n \longrightarrow (1 \oplus A_1) \times \cdots \times (1 \oplus A_n) \times (1 \oplus \cdots \oplus 1),
\end{align*}
which is obtained by combining the \kl{views} for all $i \in \set{1,\ldots,n}$ and the \kl{shape}, is injective. 
\end{lemma}
\AP We prove this by exhibiting an explicit partial left inverse: a
\intro{reconstruction} function of type
\[ \qquad (1 \oplus A_1) \times \cdots \times (1 \oplus A_n) \times (1 \oplus \cdots
  \oplus 1) \longrightarrow (A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n) + 1 \]
such that deconstruction followed by reconstruction maps every element of $A_1
\oplus \cdots \oplus A_n$ to itself. The idea is to start with the \kl{shape}
and replace the entries from $1$ with the semigroup elements appearing in the
\kl{views} in the right order. Rather than a formal definition, we illustrate
this on an example (we omit the 1s in the views to avoid visual
cluttering):
\[\arraycolsep=1.4pt\def\arraystretch{1.2}
  \begin{array}{ccccccc}
    \blue{\boxed{aba}}
    & & & &
    \blue{\boxed{aa}}\\
    &
    \red{\boxed{b}} &  
    & 
    \red{\boxed{b}} & 
    & 
      \red{\boxed{abba}}\\
     & & 
    \boxed{aa} & &  & & 
    \boxed{b}\\
    \blue{\boxed{1}} &
    \red{\boxed{1}} &
    \boxed{1} &
    \red{\boxed{1}} &
    \blue{\boxed{1}} &
    \red{\boxed{1}} &
    \boxed{1}
  \end{array}
  \qquad\mapsto\qquad \blue{\boxed{aba}} \cdot 
  \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
  \boxed{aa} \cdot 
  \red{\boxed{b}} \cdot 
  \blue{\boxed{aa}} \cdot 
  \red{\boxed{abba}} \cdot 
  \boxed{b}
\]
Besides proving \Cref{lem:views}, this reconstruction function also enjoys the following property.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:reconstruction}
  When each $A_i$ is either $A$ or $1$, \kl{reconstruction} can be seen as a \kl{copyless natural function} between \kl{polynomial functors} in $A$.
\end{proposition}
