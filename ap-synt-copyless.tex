\section{Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:functorial-sst-complete}}
In this part of the appendix, we prove~\Cref{lem:functorial-sst-complete}, which says that the models defined in Definitions~\ref{def:usual-sst} and~\ref{def:functorial-sst} define the same (total) string-to-semigroup functions.

The easy implication is left-to-right. 
    A streaming streaming transducer as in Definition~\ref{def:usual-sst} can be seen as a special case of an \sst as in Definition~\ref{def:functorial-sst}, because the sets of register valuations and register updates are constructed using finite polynomial functors, and the application operation is natural and copyless. 

The rest of this section is devoted to the harder right-to-left implication. 

\subparagraph*{A syntactic description.} The main step in the proof of the right-to-left implication is an analysis of what can be done by copyless natural functions between polynomial functors.
%     (TODO complete)
%     % For the converse implication, we observe that the component in an abstract finite polynomial functor $\functor A$ can be stored in the state of an \sst, and the register values can be stored in $A^k$ for sufficiently large $k$.
%     % Consider now the other implication in the lemma, which is the one that we use in this proof. In the case when the register functor is $A^k$ for some $k$,  a functorial \sst is a special case of an \sst with regular lookahead; and regular lookahead can be eliminated~\cite[Lemma 13.6]{bojanczyk_automata_2018}. To accommodate more general polynomial functors as register functors,  
% \end{proof}



We begin with \emph{monomial functors}, i.e.~polynomial functors with one component. 
Consider two monomial functors, say $A^k$ and $A^\ell$, for some  $k,\ell \in \mathbb{N} = \set{0,1,\ldots}$.
One way of specifying a natural transformation between these two functors is to start with a function 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:syntactic-description}    \alpha : \set{1,\ldots,\ell} \to \set{1,\ldots,k}^+,
\end{equation}
which we call a \emph{syntactic description}, and to then  define the  natural transformation as follows. For a semigroup $A$, the corresponding function of type $A^k \to A^\ell$  maps a tuple $\bar a \in A^k$ to the tuple in $A^\ell$ defined by
\[
\set{1,\ldots,\ell}
\xrightarrow{\;\text{syntactic description}\;}
\set{1,\ldots,k}^+ 
\xrightarrow{\;\text{substitute $\bar a$}\;}
A^+
\xrightarrow{\;\text{semigroup operation}\;}
A.
\]
It turns out that all  natural transformations between monomial functors arise this way, i.e.~they are in one-to-one correspondence with syntactic descriptions. To see this, the syntactic description is recovered by using the natural transformation for the free semigroup $A=\set{1,\ldots,k}^+$, and applying it to the tuple $(1,\ldots,k) \in A^k$.
The advantage of the syntactic description, which is unique, is that it allows us to define the  {copyless restriction} in a more syntactic way, reminiscent of the definition used in Definition~\ref{def:usual-sst}:  a natural function between two monomial functors is copyless if and only if its syntactic description has the following property: (*) after concatenating all $\ell$ output strings gives a string where each letter from $\set{1,\ldots,k}$ appears at most once. 

We now extend this syntactic description to natural transformations between general polynomial functors 
\begin{align*}
\functor A = \coprod_{q \in Q} A^{\dim q} \qquad 
\functorg A = \coprod_{p \in P} A^{\dim p},
\end{align*}
which are not necessarily monomial. These transformations also admit syntactic descriptions: for every input component $q$, there is some designated output component $p$, and a natural transformation $A^{\dim q} \to A^{\dim p}$.  The set of possible syntactic descriptions is
\begin{align*}
\prod_{q \in Q} \coprod_{p \in P} \dim p \to (\dim q)^+.
\end{align*}
Again, all natural transformation of polynomial functors arise this way.
We then have:
\begin{claim}
  A natural transformation between polynomial functors is copyless in the sense of \Cref{def:copyless} if and only if for every input component, the corresponding natural transformation between monomial functors is copyless.
\end{claim}

\subparagraph*{Proof of the left-to-right implication in Lemma~\ref{lem:functorial-sst-complete}.} Using the syntactic descriptions introduced above, we can complete the proof of the harder left-to-right implication in Lemma~\ref{lem:functorial-sst-complete}. Consider a functorial streaming string transducer as in Definition~\ref{def:functorial-sst}, which uses the register and update functors 
\begin{align*} 
\functorr A = \coprod_{q \in Q} A^{\dim q} \qquad 
\functors A = \coprod_{p \in P} A^{\dim p}.
\end{align*}
For an input string $a_1 \cdots a_n$, consider the sequence of register valuations 
\begin{align*}
v_1,\ldots,v_n \in \functorr A,
\end{align*}
such that $v_i$ arises by applying the first $i$ register updates produced by the update oracle. Let $k$ be the maximal dimension of the components in $Q$ (here we use the assumption that $\functorr$ is a \emph{finite} polynomial functor). Define a register valuation $w_i \in A^{k+1}$ as follows: take the register valuation used by $v_i$, and pad it to a tuple of length  $k+1$ using some distinguished element $a_0 \in A$. In particular, since $k$ is the maximal dimension of $Q$, we are guaranteed that the last coordinate with index $k+1$ stores the distinguished element $a_0$. We will show a streaming string transducer, as in Definition~\ref{def:usual-sst}, in which the set of register names is $\set{1,\ldots,k}$. 

We begin by looking at the components.  Let $q_i \in Q$ be the component of the register valuation $v_i$. The first observation is that $q_i$ depends only on $q_{i-1}$ and the $i$-th register update. Therefore, the sequence $q_1 \cdots q_n$ can be produced by a rational function. The next observation is that, one we know the components $q_{i-1}$ and $q_{i}$, and the register update $u_i \in \functoru A$ that would be applied in the original transducer to from $v_{i-1}$ to $v_i$, then we can create a copyless register update that transforms $w_{i-1}$ into $w_i$. This is done by using the syntactic descriptions of natural functions that were described above. Once we have the register valuations $w_1,\ldots,w_n$, the output of the transducer can be easily obtained.
