\section{Uncountably many recognizability-reflecting functions}

Consider the semigroup $(\Nat, +)$ of natural numbers with addition, which is isomorphic to the free monoid $a^*$. In this semigroup, the recognizable functions are ultimately periodic colourings of numbers. A corollary is that every recognizable function gives the same answer to all factorials $\set{1!,2!,\ldots}$, with finitely many exceptions. Take any function $f\colon \Nat \to \Nat$ such that (a) every output number arises from at most finitely many input numbers; (b) every output number is a factorial. The composition of $f$ with any recognizable function will give the same answer to all numbers with finitely many exceptions, thus being also recognizable. A function with conditions (a) and (b) can be chosen in uncountably many ways, even if we require that it has linear growth.
