\label{sec:reg-char}
The two constructions in Theorems~\ref{thm:all-functions} and~\ref{thm:reco-reflecting-functions} were rather straightforward, and amounted to little more than symbol pushing. In this section, we present a more advanced  characterization, which concerns  the regular functions mentioned in the introduction.
%, i.e.~string-to-string functions recognized by streaming string transducers and their equivalent models.
In the characterization, we require that the functor is finiteness preserving, i.e.~it maps finite semigroups to finite semigroups. It turns out that the naturality of the output mechanism interacts with the condition that 
the functor is finiteness preserving, resulting in a strong restriction on the expressive power.

\begin{example}
    Consider the powerset functor $\powerset A$ from Example~\ref{ex:functors}. This is a finiteness preserving functor, since the powerset of a finite set is also finite. One could imagine that using the powerset functor we could construct some transducer semigroup which recognizes functions that are not regular, e.g.~because they have exponential growth (whereas for a regular function, the output length grows at most linearly in the input length). It turns out that this is impossible, because there is no possible output mechanism, i.e.~no natural transformation $\powerset A \xrightarrow[\;\outfun_A\;]{} A$.

    The reason why is that it require some kind of choice, which would contradict naturality. More formally, let $A$ be a semigroup with two elements, with a trivial semigroup operation defined by $xy=x$. Then $\outfun_A$ would need to choose some element $a \in A$ for the full set $A \in \powerset A$. However, none of the two choices is right, because if we take any semigroup homomorphism $f : A \to A$ such that $f(A)=A$, then  naturality of the output mechanism implies that $a=f(a)$. If $f$ swaps the two elements, then we get a contradiction.
\end{example}


We now state the main theorem of this paper. Unlike the previous characterizations, the statement is stated in terms of functions between free semigroups $\Sigma^+$ and $\Gamma^+$, because the models defining regular functions are defined for string-to-string functions, and not transformations of abstract semigroups. (Some of the models, such as streaming string transducers or two-way automata, easily make sense when the output is an abstract semigroup, but the string structure of the input semigroup seems to be essential for all the models.) 

% Among the functors described in Example~\ref{ex:functors},  ``reverse'' and ``powerset''  are finiteness preserving, in the sense that if they are applied to a finite semigroup, then the result is also a finite semigroup. The ``tuple'' functor $A^n$ is finiteness preserving if and only if the exponent $n$ is finite. The ``list'' functor $A^+$ is not finiteness preserving. 


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:regular-functions}
    Let  $\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$  be finite alphabets. The following conditions are equivalent for a function $f : \Sigma^+ \to \Gamma^+$, which is not necessarily a semigroup homomorphism:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \label{it:regular} $f$ is  a regular function, as defined in  Section~\ref{sec:easy}. 
        \item \label{it:trans-semig-regular}$f$ is recognized by a transducer semigroup $(\functor,\outfun)$ such that for every finite semigroup $A$, the semigroup $\functor A$ is also finite. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}


Before proceeding with the proof, we comment on the role of empty strings. Regular functions are usually defined for possibly empty strings, i.e.~functions of type $\Sigma^* \to \Gamma^*$. We use nonempty strings, because it will be more convenient to work with semigroups, and the free semigroup construction produces nonempty strings. To extend the construction to functions that can output possibly empty strings, while still working with semigroups, we could modify the type of the output mechanism to be 
\begin{align*}
\outfun_A : \functor A \to \myunderbrace{A + 1}{disjoint union of underlying set of $A$ \\ with one extra element representing the empty word},
\end{align*}
under this modification the same proof as presented below would give us exactly the regular functions with possibly empty outputs. The empty string as an input is less important, since we can always  extend  the source code of a transducer that inputs nonempty strings with an extra line which says how to handle an empty input string. 


The left-to-right implication is relatively straightforward, and presented in Section~\ref{sec:easy}, together with the definition of streaming string transducers. The main part of the proof  is devoted to the right-to-left implication. The proof is presented in a way which, if sometimes slightly verbose, makes it easier to see how it can be adapted to other algebraic structures instead of semigroups (such as forest algebras).

\subsection{Proof}

We now present proof of the right-to-left implication in Theorem~\ref{thm:regular-functions}. Consider some transducer semigroup, with the functor being $\functor$ and the output transformation being $\outfun$. We will show that for every finite alphabet $\Sigma$, every semigroup $A$ (not necessarily a free semigroup $\Gamma^+$), the composition 
\[
    \begin{tikzcd}
    \Sigma^+ 
    \ar[r,"h"]
    &
    \functor A
    \ar[r,"\outfun_A"]
    &
    A
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
is recognized by a functorial \sst.


We begin by introducing some notation, which allows us to track which parts of an output come from which parts of an input. The new notation will be explained using the running example of the duplicating function 
\begin{align*}
f : \set{a,b}^+ \to \set{a,b}^+
\end{align*}
which is recognized by the 
transducer semigroup 
in which the functor $\functor$ is the identity, the output mechanism is duplication, and the homomorphism 
\begin{align*}
h : \set{a,b}^+ \to \functor \set{a,b}^+ = \set{a,b}^+
\end{align*}
is the identity.

%  Let us extend the output mechanism from semigroups to co-products of semigroups. This is done as follows, for semigroups $A_1,\ldots,A_n$, define the corresponding output mechanism to be the composition of the following functions 
% \[
% \begin{tikzcd}
% \functor A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \functor A_n
% \ar[d, "\functor \iota_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \functor \iota_n"]\\
% \functor (A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n) \oplus \cdots \oplus \functor (A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n)
% \ar[d, "\outfun_{A_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \outfun_{A_n}"]\\
% A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n
% \end{tikzcd}
% \]
% We use the name \emph{co-product output mechanism} for the function described above. 
For semigroups $A_1,\ldots,A_n$, define the \emph{factorized output function} to be the 
function of type 
\begin{align*}
\functor A_1 \times \cdots \times \functor A_n \to A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n
\end{align*}
that is obtained by composing the three functions described below
\tito{I believe the previous def was wrong (not consistent with the example), I've changed it to a non-equivalent one that looks like it does what we want}
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
\functor A_1 \times \cdots \times \functor A_n
\ar[d,"\functor(\text{co-projection}) \times \cdots \times \functor(\text{co-projection})"]
\\
\functor(A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n)
\times
\cdots
\times 
\functor(A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n)
\ar[d,"\text{semigroup operation}"]
\\
\functor(A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n)
\ar[d, "\outfun_{A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n}"]\\ 
A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n.
\end{tikzcd}
\]

Let us illustrate the factorized output function on our running example, with 
\begin{align*}
A_1 = 1 \qquad A_2 = \set{a,b}^+.
\end{align*}
If we apply the factorized output function to 
\begin{align*}
(1, abbb)  \in \functor A_1 \times \functor A_2 = A_1 \times A_2
\end{align*}
then the output will be 
\begin{align*}
1 abbb 1 abbb.
\end{align*}

If we fix $n$, then the factorized output function is a natural in the sense that the following diagram commutes 
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    [column sep=2cm]
\functor A_1 \times \cdots \times \functor A_n
\ar[r,"\text{factorized output}"]
\ar[d,"\functor h_1 \times \cdots \times \functor h_n"']
&
A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n
\ar[d,"h_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus h_n"]
\\
\functor B_1 \times \cdots \times \functor B_n
\ar[r,"\text{factorized output}"']
&
B_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus B_n
\end{tikzcd}
\]
for every semigroup homomorphisms $h_i : A_i \to B_i$. In other words, the factorized output function is a natural 
transformation of type 
\[\begin{tikzcd}
    [column sep=1cm]
    {\text{Semigroups}^n} && {\text{Sets}}
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center}, "{(A_1,\ldots,A_n)} \mapsto \text{underlying set of } \functor A_1 \times \cdots \times \functor A_n", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "{(A_1,\ldots,A_n)} \mapsto \text{underlying set of } A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow[ shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=0, to=1]
\end{tikzcd}\]
The reason for naturality is that each of the three steps in the definition of the factorized output is itself a natural transformation, and natural transformations compose. 


% By abuse of notation, we allow some -- but not all -- of the arguments in the factorized output to be empty; in this case the empty arguments are ignored, but the output type is still a co-product of $n$ semigroups. For example, if the input to the factorized output function is 
% \begin{align*}
% (1, \varepsilon) \in 1 \oplus \set{a,b}^+
% \end{align*}
% then the factorized  output is  
% \begin{align*}
% 1 1     \in 1 \oplus \set{a,b}^+.
% \end{align*}
    

For  input strings $w_1,\ldots,w_n \in \Sigma^+$ let use write 
\begin{align*}
\tuple{w_1| \cdots | w_n} \in \myunderbrace{A \oplus \cdots \oplus A}{$n$ times}
\end{align*}
to be the result of first applying $h$ to all the strings, and then applying the factorized output function. By abuse of notation, we allow some, but not all of the input strings to be empty, in which case the appropriate values in the coproduct are ignored, but the output type is not changed. In our running example, we have
\begin{align*}
    \tuple{abbbbb | \varepsilon | bbabaaa} =  
    \myunderbrace{abbbbb}{in first \\ copy of \\ $\set{a,b}^+$}
     \myunderbrace{bbabaaa}{in third \\ copy of \\ $\set{a,b}^+$}
     \myunderbrace{abbbbb}{in first \\ copy of \\ $\set{a,b}^+$}
     \myunderbrace{bbabaaa}{in third \\ copy of \\ $\set{a,b}^+$}.
    \end{align*}


We also use a similar notation but with some strings underlined; in the underlined case, to the non-underlined strings we apply $h$, and to the underlined strings we apply 
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
\Sigma^+ 
\ar[r,"h"]
&
\functor A 
\ar[r,"\functor !"]
&
\functor 1.
\end{tikzcd}
\]



The following lemma is the key part of our construction. We consider $A \mapsto A \oplus 1$ and $A \mapsto 1 \oplus A \oplus 1$ as a polynomial functors as explained in Example~\ref{ex:coproduct-as-polynomial-functor}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:compute-next-configuration}
    There exists a \emph{copyless} natural transformation of polynomial functors
    \begin{align*}
    \delta_A : (A \oplus 1) \times (1 \oplus A \oplus 1) \to A \oplus 1
    \end{align*} 
    and some function 
    \begin{align*}
    o : \Sigma^* \times \Sigma \times \Sigma^*  \to  1 \oplus A \oplus 1
    \end{align*}
    which is recognizable in the sense that was defined in Section~\ref{sec:functorial-sst}, such that  for every strings $w,v \in \Sigma^*$ and every letter $a \in \Sigma$ we have 
    \begin{align*}
    \tuple{wa|\underline v}  = \delta_A(\tuple{w|\underline{av}}, o(w,a,v)).
    \end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We begin with the following claim, which shows that there is no difference if we merge parts before or after applying the factorized output operation. It is obtained by expanding the latter's definition, using the naturality of $\outfun$ and the fact that  both $h$ and merging the first two \enquote{copies of $A$} in $A \oplus A \oplus 1$ (by copairing coprojections) are homomorphisms.
    \begin{claim}\label{claim:merge-factorized-output}
        The following diagram commutes 
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            [column sep=3cm]
        \Sigma^* \times \Sigma \times \Sigma^* 
        \ar[r,"{(w,a,v) \mapsto \tuple{w|a|\underline v}}"]
        \ar[d,"{(w,a,v) \mapsto (wa,v)}"']
        &
        A \oplus A \oplus 1
        \ar[d,"\text{merge first two coordinates}"]
        \\
        \Sigma^+ \times \Sigma^* 
        \ar[r,"{(wa,v) \mapsto \tuple{wa|\underline v}}"']
        &
        A  \oplus 1
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    \end{claim}
    \tito{I checked the claim for the new definition of factorized output function, but I don't know if the details are worth spelling out (it's purely mechanical)}

    Thanks to the above claim, we know that  the desired value $\tuple{wa|\underline v}$ is obtained from  $\tuple{w|a| \underline v}$
    by applying a copyless natural transformation, namely merging the first two coordinates. 
     Lemma~\ref{lem:views} gives us a natural injection
    \[ \iota_A : A \oplus (A \oplus 1) \xrightarrow{\;\text{pairing of $\view_A$ and $\view_{A \oplus 1}$}\;} (A \oplus 1) \times (1 \oplus A \oplus 1) \]
    and, using again the naturality of the components in the factorized output function, we have
    \[ \iota(\tuple{w|a| \underline v}) = (\tuple{w|\underline{av}},\tuple{\underline w| a| \underline v}) \]
    The inverse of $\iota_A$, which is partial, can be extended to a total function
    \[ \rho_A : (A \oplus 1) \times (1 \oplus A \oplus 1) \to A \oplus (A \oplus 1) \]
    by mapping all elements outside the range of $\iota$ to the unique element of $A \oplus (A \oplus 1)$ that does not involve $A$. This is natural in $A$ and copyless.
        \tito{TODO justify natural and copyless}
    
    To conclude, by setting
    \[ \delta_A = (\text{merge two $A$s in $A \oplus A \oplus 1$}) \circ \rho_A \qquad o(w,a,v) = \tuple{\underline w| a| \underline v} \]
    we satisfy the equation in the lemma statement. It remains to check that the map $o$ is recognizable. This is the case because $\tuple{\underline w| a| \underline v}$ depends only on the letter $a$ and the images of $w$ and $v$ under the homomorphism $\functor ! \circ h$, which has finite codomain. This last step is crucial: this is where we use the assumption that $\functor 1$ is finite.
\end{proof}


Thanks to the above lemma, we can construct a device which is almost a functorial \sst as described in Section~\ref{sec:functorial-sst} and which recognizes our desired function $w \mapsto \tuple{w}$. We say ``almost'', because the device will use register and update functors that are  infinite polynomial functors; this construction will be later improved so that it becomes finite.  The register and update functors are 
\begin{align*}
\functorr A  = A \oplus 1 \qquad \functors A = 1 \oplus A \oplus 1
\end{align*}
As mentioned above, these are  not a finite polynomial functors; we will resolve this problem shortly. Beyond that, the construction is immediate: if we take the register update term $\delta$ and the oracle $o$ as in the above lemma, and we define the initial register value to be 
\begin{align*}
\myunderbrace{\tuple{\varepsilon | \underline{a_1 \cdots a_n}}}{this does not depend on the input string $a_1 \cdots a_n$, \\ it is equal to the unique element of $1 \oplus A$ that does not use $A$}
\end{align*}
then the resulting machine will have the property that  if the input string is $a_1 \cdots a_n$, then its $i$-th configuration is 
\begin{align*}
\tuple{a_1 \cdots a_{i}| \underline{a_{i+1} \cdots a_n}}.
\end{align*}
In particular, the last configuration is $\tuple{a_1 \cdots a_n | \varepsilon}$, which is the same as the output when viewed as an element of $A \oplus 1$. Therefore, to get the output, we should apply the partial copyless natural transformation of type $A \oplus 1 \to A$ which is the one-sided inverse of the embedding of $A$ in $A \oplus 1$.  
\tito{It's a bit inelegant since our categorical definition yields total functions}

The only remaining issue with our construction is that the two functors, i.e.~the register functor and the update functors, are not finite polynomial functors. This problem is overcome by observing that not all of $1 \oplus A$ need be used for the register values, only a small part of it, and likewise for the update functor. More formally, 
consider the natural bijection
\begin{align*}
A \oplus 1  \quad \cong \quad 
\myunderbrace{\coprod_{q \in 1 \oplus 1}  A^{\dim q}}{call this the \emph{register representation} of $A \oplus 1$}
\end{align*}
that was discussed in Example~\ref{ex:coproduct-as-polynomial-functor}. If we apply it to an element of the form
\begin{align*}
\tuple{w|\underline {v}} \in A \oplus 1,
\end{align*}
then the corresponding component will be $\tuple {\underline w | \underline v}$. Since the latter depends only  on $\underline w$ and $\underline v$, and these take values in the finite semigroup $\functor 1$, it follows that there are only finitely many components of $A \oplus 1$ that will be used to represent values from of the form $\tuple {w | \underline v}$. Therefore, instead of using $\functorr A$ to be all of $A \oplus 1$, we can restrict it to those finitely many components, giving thus a finite polynomial functor. The same argument can be applied to the update functor $\functors A$.
