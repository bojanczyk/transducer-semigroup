\section{The regular functions}
\label{sec:reg-char}
The two straightforward constructions in Theorems~\ref{thm:all-functions} and~\ref{thm:reco-reflecting-functions}  amount to little more than symbol pushing. In this section, we present a more substantial characterization, which is the main result of this paper.
% In this characterization, we use functors that are finiteness-preserving.
This characterization concerns \kl{finiteness-preserving} functors.
% (above rephrased mainly to avoid vertical alignment of two occurrences of "finiteness-preserving")
This is a strengthening of the condition from Theorem~\ref{thm:reco-reflecting-functions}: if the functor $\functor$ in a \kl{transducer semigroup} is \kl{finiteness-preserving}, then for every finite semigroup $A$, the output function $\functor A \to A$ will be \kl{recognizable}, since all functions from a finite semigroup are trivially recognizable.  However, the condition is strictly stronger, as witnessed by Example~\ref{ex:squaring}, which is \kl{recognizability reflecting} (cf.~\Cref{ex:squaring-reco-refl}) but not \kl{finiteness preserving}. As we will see, the stronger condition will characterize exactly the \kl{regular string-to-string functions}.

The following counterexample illustrates the non-trivial interaction between \kl{naturality} of the \kl{output mechanism} and the requirement that the functor is \kl{finiteness preserving}.

\begin{example}
    Consider the powerset functor $\powerset$ from Example~\ref{ex:functors}. It is \kl{finiteness preserving}, since the powerset of a finite semigroup is also finite. One could imagine that using powersets, one could construct a \kl{transducer semigroup} that recognizes functions that are not regular, e.g.~because they have exponential growth (unlike \kl{regular functions}, which have linear growth). It turns out that this is impossible, because there is no possible \kl{output mechanism}, i.e.~no \kl{natural transformation} of type $\powerset A \to A$, as we explain below.

    The issue is that the \kl{naturality} condition disallows choosing elements from a subset.  To see why, consider a semigroup $A$ with two elements, with the trivial \kl{left zero} semigroup structure. For this semigroup, the \kl{output mechanism} of type $\powerset A \to A$ would need to choose some element $a \in A$ when given as input the full set $A \in \powerset A$. However, none of the two choices is right, because swapping the two elements of $A$ is an automorphism of the semigroup $A$, which maps the full set to itself, but does not map any element to itself.
\end{example}

We now state the main theorem of this paper. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:regular-functions}
    The following conditions are equivalent for every string-to-string function:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \label{it:regular} it is a \kl{regular string-to-string function};
        \item \label{it:trans-semig-regular}it is recognized by a \kl{transducer
            semigroup}  in which the functor is \kl{finiteness preserving};
        \item \label{it:trans-semig-f1}it is recognized by a transducer
            semigroup in which the functor $\functor$ \emph{maps the singleton
          semigroup $1$ to a finite semigroup}: $|\functor1|<\infty$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\noindent (Note that $(\ref{it:trans-semig-regular}) \Rightarrow (\ref{it:trans-semig-f1})$ is
immediate.) Here is the plan for the rest of this section:
\begin{description}
    \item[Section~\ref{sec:sst-definition}] gives a formal definition of \kl{regular functions}
    \item[Section~\ref{sec:easy}] proves the easy  implication in the theorem, namely  $(\ref{it:regular}) \Rightarrow (\ref{it:trans-semig-regular})$
    \item[Section~\ref{sec:hard}] proves the hard  implication in the theorem, namely  $(\ref{it:trans-semig-f1}) \Rightarrow (\ref{it:regular})$
\end{description}

Before continuing, we remark on one advantage of the characterization in item
(\ref{it:trans-semig-regular}), namely a straightforward proof of closure under
composition. In contrast, for some (but not all) existing models defining
\kl{regular string-to-string functions}, composition requires a non-trivial
construction -- examples include two-way transducers~\cite[Theorem 2]{ChytilJ77}
or copyless \kl{streaming string transducers}~\cite[Theorem 1]{composingSST}.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:composition}
  Functions recognized by finiteness-preserving transducer semigroups are closed
  under composition.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  This is because \kl{finiteness-preserving} functors are closed under composition,
  \kl{natural} families of \kl{output functions} are also closed under composition, and \kl{naturality}
  means by definition that the \kl{output functions} \enquote{commute} in a suitable
  sense with functors.

  More precisely, consider the following diagram:
    \[
      \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&, column sep=2cm]
        \Sigma^* 
        \ar[r,"h"]
        \& 
        \functor(\Gamma^*)
        \ar[r,"\outfun_{\Gamma^*}"]
        \ar[d,"\functor h'"]
        \&
        \Gamma^* \ar[d,"h'"]\\
        \&
        \functor\functor'(\Pi^*) \ar[r,"\outfun_{\functor'(\Pi^*)}"]
        \& 
        \functor'(\Pi^*)
        \ar[r,"\outfun'_{(\Pi^*)}"]
        \&
        \Pi^*
      \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  where the square commutes because the output mechanism is \kl{natural}. The upper path describes the composition of two functions recognized by the
  \kl{transducer semigroups} $(\functor,\outfun)$ and $(\functor',\outfun')$,
  while the lower path describes a function recognized by $(\functor\functor',
  \outfun_{\functor'(-)} \circ \outfun')$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Factorized output}
Now, consider some \kl{transducer semigroup}, with the functor being $\functor$, and fix a string-to-semigroup function $f\colon \Sigma^* \to A$ that decomposes as some homomorphism $h\colon \Sigma^* \to \functor A$ followed by the \kl{output function} of type $\functor A \to A$. 

\AP For semigroups $A_1,\ldots,A_n$, define the \intro{vectorial output function} to be the 
function of type 
\begin{align*}
\qquad\functor A_1 \times \cdots \times \functor A_n \longrightarrow A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n
\end{align*}
that is obtained by the composition of three functions described below (where \intro{co-projection} is the function $A_i \to A_1 \oplus \dots \oplus A_n$ that outputs a singleton list containing its input):
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
\functor A_1 \times \cdots \times \functor A_n
\ar[d,"\functor(\text{\kl{co-projection}}) \times \cdots \times \functor(\text{\kl{co-projection}})"]
\\
\functor(A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n)
\times
\cdots
\times 
\functor(A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n)
\ar[d,"\text{semigroup operation}"]
\\
\functor(A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n)
\ar[d, "\text{\kl{output mechanism} for $A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n$}"]\\ 
A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n.
\end{tikzcd}
\]

\AP To illustrate the definitions in this section, we use a \intro{running example} with the
\kl{transducer semigroup} for the \enquote{reverse then duplicate} function from
\Cref{ex:reverse-duplicate}. The functor $\functor$ sends a semigroup $A$ to the
opposite semigroup (cf.~\Cref{ex:functors}), and the \kl{output mechanism} is $a
\mapsto aa$. Our example function on $\set{a,b}^*$ is obtained by composing the
string reversal homomorphism $\set{a,b}^* \to \functor(\set{a,b}^*)$ with the
\kl{output function}. Here is an example of the \kl{vectorial output function} (for now,
the homomorphism plays no role):
\begin{align*}
    (\red{1},\blue{abbb}) \in \red{\functor 1} \times \blue{\functor(\set{a,b}^*)} \qquad \mapsto \qquad 
  \blue{\boxed{abbb}} \ \red{\boxed{1}} \  \blue{\boxed{abbb}}\ \red{\boxed{1}} \in \red{1} \oplus \blue{\set{a,b}^*}.
\end{align*}
The \kl{vectorial output function} is \kl{natural} in all of its arguments, which means
that for all semigroup homomorphisms $h_1,\ldots,h_n$, the diagram below commutes:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    [column sep=4cm]
\functor A_1 \times \cdots \times \functor A_n
\ar[r,"\text{vectorial output function}"]
\ar[d,"\functor h_1 \times \cdots \times \functor h_n"']
&
A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n
\ar[d,"h_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus h_n"]
\\
\functor B_1 \times \cdots \times \functor B_n
\ar[r,"\text{vectorial output function}"]
&
B_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus B_n
\end{tikzcd}
\]
This is because each of the three steps in the definition of the \kl{vectorial output function} is itself a \kl{natural transformation}, and natural transformations compose.  Naturality of the first two steps is easy to check, while for the last step we use the assumption that the (non-vectorial) \kl{output function} is natural.
% In other words, the factorized output function is a natural 
% transformation of type 
% \[\begin{tikzcd}
%     [column sep=1cm]
%     {\text{Semigroups}^n} && {\text{Sets}}
%     \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center}, "{(A_1,\ldots,A_n)} \mapsto \text{underlying set of } \functor A_1 \times \cdots \times \functor A_n", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
%     \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "{(A_1,\ldots,A_n)} \mapsto \text{underlying set of } A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_n"', curve={height=18pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
%     \arrow[ shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=0, to=1]
% \end{tikzcd}\]



% By abuse of notation, we allow some -- but not all -- of the arguments in the factorized output to be empty; in this case the empty arguments are ignored, but the output type is still a co-product of $n$ semigroups. For example, if the input to the factorized output function is 
% \begin{align*}
% (1, \varepsilon) \in 1 \oplus \set{a,b}^+
% \end{align*}
% then the factorized  output is  
% \begin{align*}
% 1 1     \in 1 \oplus \set{a,b}^+.
% \end{align*}

\AP Let us return to our function $f = \outfun_A \circ h$ recognized by our \kl{transducer semigroup} $(\functor,\outfun)$.
%Using the vectorial output mechanism, we will be able to track the origins in the output of the function $f$, with respect to some partition of the input string into several nonempty parts.
For strings $w_1,\ldots,w_n \in \Sigma^*$, define the corresponding \intro{factorized output} to be the result of first applying the semigroup homomorphism $h : \Sigma^* \to \functor A$ to all the strings, and then applying the \kl{vectorial output function}; we denote it by 
\begin{align*}
\tuple{w_1| \cdots | w_n} \in \myunderbrace{A \oplus \cdots \oplus A}{$n$ times},
\end{align*}
Here is the \kl{factorized output} illustrated on our \kl{running example} (we use colours to distinguish which of the three parts of the input is used):
\begin{align*}
  \tuple{\red{abb} | \varepsilon | \blue{baaba}} =  
  \blue{\boxed{abaab}} \ 
  \boxed{\varepsilon} \ 
  \red{\boxed{bba}} \ 
  \blue{\boxed{abaab}} \
  \boxed{\varepsilon} \
  \red{\boxed{bba}}
  \in \red{\set{a,b}^*} \oplus \set{a,b}^*  \oplus \blue{\set{a,b}^*}.
\end{align*}
As we can see above, when the output semigroup is a free monoid, the \kl{factorized output} morally tells us \enquote{which part of the output string comes from which part in the input string}.
\begin{remark}
This is similar to the idea of \emph{origin semantics}~\cite{bojanczykTransducersOriginInformation2014} of regular functions (see also~\cite[Section~5]{MuschollPuppis}). Indeed, our definition of factorized output is inspired by a similar tool of the same name that appears in the study of origin semantics~\cite[Section~2]{bojanczykTransducersOriginInformation2014}.
\end{remark}

We also use a similar notation but with some input strings underlined, e.g.~the input could be $\tuple{\red{\underline{abb}} | \varepsilon | \blue{baaba}}$ with an underline for the first red part. In the underlined case, before applying the \kl{vectorial output function}, we apply $h$ to the non-underlined strings and
$(\functor! \circ h) \colon \Sigma^* \to \functor1$
to the underlined strings. In our \kl{running example}, we have
\begin{align*}
  \tuple{\red{\underline{abb}} | \varepsilon | \blue{baaba}} =  
  \blue{\boxed{abaab}} \ 
  \boxed{\varepsilon} \ 
  \red{\boxed{1}} \ 
  \blue{\boxed{abaab}} \
  \boxed{\varepsilon} \
  \red{\boxed{1}}
  \in \red{1} \oplus \set{a,b}^*  \oplus \blue{\set{a,b}^*}.
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Proof of $(\ref{it:trans-semig-f1}) \Rightarrow (\ref{it:regular})$ in \Cref{thm:regular-functions}}
We have now collected all necessary ingredients to prove this hard direction of
the equivalence. Therefore, our goal is now to show that the function $f\colon
\Sigma^* \to A$ that we have previously fixed is computed by some \kl{functorial streaming string transducer} as in Definition~\ref{def:functorial-sst},
\emph{assuming that $\functor 1$ is finite}.

The idea is that we want the \functorialsst to maintain the following \intro{invariant}: 
\begin{center}
  after processing the first $i$ letters in an input string $a_1 \cdots a_n$,\\ the register valuation is equal to the \kl{factorized output} $\tuple{a_1 \cdots a_i | \underline{a_{i+1} \cdots a_n}}$.
\end{center}
 This way, after processing all input letters, the last valuation $\tuple{a_1 \cdots a_n | \underline{\varepsilon}}$ is very close to the output; indeed, if we see $A$ as a 1-ary coproduct, then $f(a_1\dots a_n) = \tuple{a_1 \dots a_n} \in A$.

The naive choice for the \kl{register functor} is then $\functorr' : A \mapsto A
\oplus 1$, since $\tuple{w|\underline{v}} \in A\oplus1$ for all $w,v\in\Sigma^*$
by definition. However, while $\functorr'$ can be seen as a \kl{polynomial
  semigroup-to-set functor}, whose set of \kl{components} is $1 \oplus 1$
(cf.~\Cref{prop:coproduct-as-polynomial-functor}), it is not \kl{\emph{finite}
  polynomial} (the set $1\oplus1$ is infinite). That said, we have by
\kl{naturality} of \kl{vectorial output}:\footnote{Let us give some details. From \Cref{prop:coproduct-as-polynomial-functor}, we see that the \kl{component} in $1 \oplus 1$ of an element in $A \oplus 1$ is obtained by applying $!\oplus1$. So it suffices to show that
  \[\tuple{\underline{w}|\underline{v}} = (!\oplus1)(\tuple{w|\underline{v}}) \]
  Expanding the definitions, our goal can be rewritten as
  \[ \text{vectorial output of}\ (\functor! \circ h(w),\, \functor! \circ h(v)) = (!\oplus1)\big(\text{vectorial output of}\ (h(w),\, \functor! \circ h(v))\big) \]
  This is a direct consequence of the \kl{naturality} of the \kl{vectorial output function}, that can be expressed as follows: for every semigroup homomorphism $g\colon A \to B$,
  \[ (\text{vectorial output for $B$}) \circ (\functor g \times \mathrm{id}_1) = (g\oplus1) \circ \text{vectorial output for $A$} \]
  (take $g=\;!$ and apply both sides of the equality to $(h(w),\, \functor! \circ h(v))$ to get the desired \Cref{clm:component-index}).}
\begin{claim}\label{clm:component-index}
  The \kl{component} for $\tuple{w|\underline{v}} \in \functorr'A$ is $\tuple{\underline{w}|\underline{v}} \in 1 \oplus 1$.
\end{claim}
This index is determined by definition by the values of $(\functor! \circ h)
\colon \Sigma^* \to \functor1$ on $w$ and $v$, where
$h\colon\Sigma^*\to\functor A$ is the homomorphism used to recognize $f$. \emph{Since $\functor1$ is finite,} the $\tuple{w|\underline{v}}$ for $w,v$ ranging over $\Sigma^*$ live in finitely many \kl{components}. We take our \kl{register functor}  $\functorr A \subset \functorr' A$ to be the \kl{finite polynomial functor} consisting of these \enquote{useful} \kl{components}, plus the unique \kl{component} that does not use $A$ (it will serve as a \enquote{\intro{null value}}).

To design the register updates, the key is the following lemma. It shall be proved later using the machinery of \kl{views} on \kl{coproducts} that we have introduced for this very purpose.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:compute-next-configuration}
  There are two \kl{copyless natural functions}
  \[
    \delta\colon (A \oplus 1) \times (1 \oplus A \oplus 1) \to (A \oplus 1) + 1
    \qquad\qquad
    \kappa\colon (A \oplus 1) \times (1 \oplus A) \to A + 1
  \]
  such that, for every pair of strings $w,v \in \Sigma^*$ and every letter $a
  \in \Sigma$,
  \[ \tuple{wa|\underline v} = \delta(\tuple{w|\underline
      {av}},\tuple{\underline w | a|\underline v}) \qquad\qquad f(w) = \tuple{w} =
    \kappa(\tuple{w|\underline\varepsilon},\tuple{\underline w | \varepsilon}) \]
\end{lemma}
Again, to make \enquote{\kl{copyless natural}} meaningful in this context, we invoke
\Cref{prop:coproduct-as-polynomial-functor} to see $\delta$ and $\kappa$ as
functions between \kl{polynomial functors} in $A$.

This leads us to use the \kl{update functor} $\functoru : A \mapsto 1 \oplus A \oplus
1$ and to define the application of updates to registers, of type $\functorr A
\times \functoru A \to \functorr A$, to be $\delta$ followed by the map $(A
\oplus 1) + 1 \to \functorr A$ which sends the \kl{components} of $A \oplus 1$ that
are in $\functorr A$ to themselves, and everything else to the \enquote{\kl{null value}}. As an direct consequence of the lemma, the desired \kl{invariant} holds using
\begin{itemize}
  \item the \kl{initial function} $w \mapsto \tuple{\varepsilon|\underline{w}}$,
  \item and the update oracle $a_1 \dots a_n \mapsto \tuple{\underline\varepsilon|a_1|\underline{a_2 \dots a_n}} \dots
  \tuple{\underline{a_1 \dots a_{n-1}}|a_n|\underline\varepsilon}$.
\end{itemize}
To fit \Cref{def:functorial-sst}, we have to check that the \kl{initial function} is \kl{recognizable} and that the update oracle is a \kl{rational function}; by definition, the latter amounts to saying that for any $a\in\Sigma$, the function $(w,v) \in (\Sigma^*)^2 \mapsto \tuple{\underline{w}|a|\underline{v}}$ is recognizable. According to the definition of \kl{factorized output}, the initial function factors through the semigroup homomorphism $\functor! \circ h$, \emph{whose codomain $\functor1$ is finite}; therefore, the initial function is recognizable. The other recognizability condition holds for a similar reason.

To finish building our \kl{functorial streaming string transducer}, we use the
function $\kappa$ from \Cref{lem:compute-next-configuration}. Thanks to our
\kl{invariant} and to the equation concerning $\kappa$, it is immediate that the
following choices lead to a \functorialsst that indeed computes $f$. We take:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \kl{final data functor} $\functork : A \mapsto (1 \oplus A)\times A$,
\item the \kl{final data function} $w\in\Sigma^* \mapsto
  (\tuple{\underline{w}|\varepsilon},\;\text{some arbitrary fixed value in
    $A$})$ -- once again, it is \kl{recognizable} because $\functor1$ is finite,
\item and the \kl{final output function} $\functorr A \times \functork A \to A$ that
  proceeds as follows: first, it applies $\kappa$ to get some value in
  $(A+1)\times A$; if the left half of the pair is in $A$, it returns it;
  otherwise, it returns the right half.
\end{itemize}
This being done, let us discharge our only remaining subgoal.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{lem:compute-next-configuration}]
  We cover here the part concerning $\delta$; for $\kappa$, the arguments are
  similar and a bit simpler. We use the following claim, which is proved using
  mechanical diagram chasing (as detailed in the appendix). Recall that
  the \kl{merging}, \kl{shape} and \kl{view} operations were introduced just before
  \Cref{lem:views}.
    \begin{claim}\label{claim:merge-factorized-output}
        $\tuple{wa|\underline v}$ is obtained from $\tuple{w|a|\underline v}$ by \kl{merging} the first two parts in $A \oplus A \oplus 1$.
    \end{claim}

    The above
    claim shows that the \kl{factorized output} $\tuple{wa|\underline v}$ is
    obtained from $\tuple{w|a|\underline v}$ by a \kl{copyless natural function}.
    In turn, $\tuple{w|a|\underline v}$ is the image by the
    \kl{reconstruction} function -- which is copyless natural
    (\Cref{prop:reconstruction}) -- of the following four items (the equalities below are proved similarly to Claims~\ref{clm:component-index} and~\ref{claim:merge-factorized-output}):
     \begin{enumerate}
        \item \label{it:first-view}First \kl{view} of $\tuple{w|a|\underline v}$, which is equal to $\tuple{w|\underline {av}}$ -- this is the first argument which is passed, in the lemma statement, to the function $\delta$ that we want to define.
        \item  \label{it:second-view} Second \kl{view} of $\tuple{w|a|\underline v}$, which is obtained by \kl{merging} the first and third parts in $\tuple{\underline w|a|\underline v}$.
        \item \label{it:third-view}   Third \kl{view} of $\tuple{w|a|\underline v}$, which is equal to $\tuple{\underline {wa}|\underline{v}}$.
        \item   \label{it:shape} \kl{Shape} of~$\tuple{w|a|\underline v}$, which is equal to $\tuple{\underline w|\underline a| \underline v}$.
     \end{enumerate}

To complete the proof, it remains to justify that the last three items above can
be collectively obtained from the second argument given to $\delta$, namely $\tuple{\underline w|a|\underline v}$, by applying some \kl{copyless natural function}. Each item is obtained separately by applying a \kl{natural function}. Furthermore, the second item is obtained in a copyless way, while the last two items do not use $A$ at all, and therefore they are obtained in a copyless way for trivial reasons, even when combined with the second item.
