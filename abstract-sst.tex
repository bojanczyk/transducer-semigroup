\subsection{From a transducer semigroup to a regular function}
\label{sec:hard}
We now turn to the difficult implication $(\ref{it:trans-semig-f1}) \Rightarrow (\ref{it:regular})$ in Theorem~\ref{thm:regular-functions}. 
 The proof is presented in a way which, if sometimes slightly verbose, makes it
 easier to see how it can be adapted to other algebraic structures instead of
 semigroups (such as forest algebras, cf.~\Cref{sec:conclusion}).

\subsubsection{Polynomial functors and functorial streaming string transducers}
\label{sec:abstract-sst} 
The assumption of the implication uses an abstract model (\kl{transducer semigroups}), while the conclusion uses a concrete operational model (\kl{streaming string transducers}). To bridge the gap, we use an intermediate model, similar to \sst{}s, but a bit more abstract. The abstraction arises by using \kl{polynomial functors} instead of registers, as described below. 

\begin{definition}
  By \intro{polynomial functor}, we mean a semigroup-to-set functor of the form
\begin{align*}
\qquad A \quad \mapsto \quad \coprod_{q \in Q} A^{\text{\kl{dimension} of } q},
\end{align*}
where $Q$ is some possibly infinite set, whose elements are called \intro{components}, with each \kl{component} having an associated \intro{dimension} in $\Nat$. The symbol $\coprod$ stands for disjoint union of sets. This functor does not take into account the semigroup structure of the input semigroup, since the output is seen only as a set.
On morphisms, the functor works in the expected way, i.e.~coordinate-wise.  
\end{definition}

\AP A \intro{finite polynomial functor} is a \kl{polynomial functor} with finitely many \kl{components} -- for example, $A \mapsto A^2 + A^2 + A$. 
The notion of \kl{finite polynomial functor} can be seen as a mild generalization of the construction which maps a semigroup $A$ to the set $A^R$ of register valuations for some fixed finite set $R$ of register names.  In the generalization, we allow a variable number of registers, depending on some finite information (the component). 

Having defined a more abstract notion of \enquote{register valuations}, namely
\kl{finite polynomial functors}, we now define a more abstract notion of
\enquote{register updates}. The first condition for such updates is that they do
not look inside the register contents; this condition is captured by
\kl{naturality} (as discussed in \Cref{rem:parametricity}).

\begin{example}
    Consider the \kl{polynomial functors} (where $1$ represents the singleton set $A^0$)
    \begin{align*}
    \functor A = A^* = 1 + A^1 + A^2 + \cdots  \qquad \functorg A = A + 1.     \end{align*} 
An example of a \kl{natural transformation} between these two functors is the function which maps a nonempty list in $A^*$ to the product of its elements, and which maps the empty list to the unique element of $1$. A non-example is the function that maps a list $[a_1,\ldots,a_n] \in A^*$ to the leftmost element $a_i$ that is an idempotent in the semigroup, and returns $1$ if such an element does not exist. The reason why the non-example is not natural is that a semigroup homomorphism can map a non-idempotent to an idempotent.
\end{example}
% The naturality condition is an abstraction of the condition (a) that was mentioned before, namely that register contents are not inspected. For example, as we will see below, a natural transformations from the functor $\functor A = A^2$ to itself is $(a,b) \mapsto (abbaa,bbba)$, while 
% \begin{align*}
% (a,b) \mapsto \begin{cases}
%     (1,1) & \text{if the semigroup $A$ has an identity element $1$, and $a=1$}\\
%     (a,b) & \text{otherwise.}
% \end{cases}
% \end{align*}
% is not a natural transformation.


Apart from \kl{naturality}, we will want our register updates to be copyless.
For the purposes of the following definition, let us call a tuple of numbers in
$\Nat^k$ a \enquote{sub-unit} if it belongs to $\{0,1\}^k$ and at most one
coordinate is equal to~1 -- or, as an edge case, if $k=0$. For a \kl{polynomial
  functor} $\functor$, a sub-unit of $\functor\Nat = \sum_q \Nat^{\dim(q)}$ is a
sub-unit of any of the $\Nat^{\dim(q)}$.

\begin{definition}[Copyless natural transformation] \label{def:copyless} A
  \kl{natural transformation} between two \kl{polynomial functors} $\functor$
  and $\functorg$ is called \emph{copyless} if when instantiated to the
  semigroup\footnote{The choice of the semigroup $(\Nat,+)$ in the
    \Cref{def:copyless} is not particularly important. For example, the same
    notion of copylessness would arise if instead of $(\Nat,+)$, we used the
    semigroup $\set{0,1,2}$ with addition up to threshold $2$. In the appendix,
    we present a more syntactic characterization of copyless natural
    transformations as part of our proof of \Cref{lem:functorial-sst-complete}.}
  $(\Nat,+)$, the corresponding function of type $\functor \Nat \to
  \functorg \Nat$ maps sub-units to sub-units.
\end{definition}

\AP It will be convenient to speak of \intro{natural functions} $f\colon
\functor A \to \functorg A$, where $\functor$ and $\functorg$ are
semigroup-to-set functors and $A$ is a fixed semigroup, to refer to functions
that can be extended to \kl{natural transformations} $(f_B\colon \functor B \to
\functorg B)_{B\ \text{semigroup}}$, with $f=f_A$. \intro{Copyless natural
  functions} between instantiations of \kl{polynomial functors} are defined
analogously.

Having defined functions that are natural and copyless, we now describe the more
abstract model of \sst{}s used in our proof. The main difference is that instead
of register valuations and updates given by some finite set of register names,
we have two abstract \kl{polynomial functors}, one of them \kl{finite polynomial},
together with an explicitly given application function. We also allow the
computation to be initialized and finalized in a more liberal way, that may depend on a
regular property of the input.

\begin{definition}\label{def:functorial-sst}
    The syntax of a \intro{functorial streaming string transducer} is given by:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A finite \emph{input alphabet} $\Sigma$ and an \emph{output semigroup $A$}.
    \item A \kl{finite polynomial functor} $\functorr$, called the \intro{register functor}, and a (not necessarily finite) \kl{polynomial functor} $\functoru$ called the \intro{update functor}.
    \item A \kl{copyless natural function} of type $\functorr A \times \functoru A \to \functorr A$, called \emph{application}.
    \item An \intro{initial function} $\Sigma^* \to \functorr A$ which is \kl{recognizable} (and therefore has finite range).
    \item A polynomial \intro{final data functor} $\functork$, a \intro{final data function} $\Sigma^* \to \functork A$ which is \kl{recognizable}, and a \intro{final output function} of type $\functorr A \times \functork A \to A$ which is a \kl{natural function} (but not necessarily copyless).
    \item An \emph{update oracle}, which is a \kl{rational function} of type $\Sigma^* \to (\functoru A)^*$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Analogously to \Cref{def:usual-sst}, the \functorialsst computes the function
$\Sigma^* \to A$ obtained by the following composition, where the first map
bundles together the initial function, the update oracle and the final data
function:
\[ \Sigma^* \to \functorr A \times (\functoru A)^* \times \functork A
  \xrightarrow{\;(\text{\emph{apply} updates successively})\times\mathrm{id}_{\functork A}}
  \functorr A \times \functork A \xrightarrow{\;\text{final output function}\;}
  A \]
In the appendix, we prove that this model is no more expressive than usual copyless \sst{}s.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:functorial-sst-complete}
    Definitions~\ref{def:usual-sst} and~\ref{def:functorial-sst} characterize the same string-to-semigroup functions.
\end{lemma}
